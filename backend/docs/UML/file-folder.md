# 🏗️ Backend Architecture Overview

This document outlines the layered architecture of the backend application and explains the purpose and responsibility of each file and directory.

---

## 📁 `server.js`

- **Purpose**: Main entry point of the application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initializes the Express app and HTTP server
  - Sets up core middleware (e.g., body parser, CORS, logging)
  - Connects routes to the application
  - Configures environment variables and database connection
  - Sets up error handling and process management
  - Starts the server on specified port
- **Analogy**: The main switchboard and power control center of your application.

---

## 📁 `/routes`

- **Purpose**: Defines API endpoints (URLs) exposed by the app.
- **Structure**:
  - Each file typically corresponds to a major resource or feature (e.g., `userRoutes.js`, `projectRoutes.js`).
  - Maps HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and URL paths to controller functions.
- **Analogy**: The directory of available phone numbers and what department (controller) they connect to.

---

## 📁 `/controllers`

- **Purpose**: Handles incoming HTTP requests.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parses request data (query params, body).
  - Validates input (often via middleware).
  - Calls service layer to perform business logic.
  - Formats and sends HTTP responses.
- **Note**: Should be *thin* — delegate complex work to services.
- **Analogy**: Receptionists/operators who understand the request and route it to the correct internal department (service).

---

## 📁 `/services`

- **Purpose**: Contains core business logic.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Orchestrates operations.
  - Interacts with models/data layers.
  - Performs calculations and decision-making.
- **Note**: Independent of the web layer (no direct use of `req`, `res`).
- **Analogy**: Specialized departments (e.g., compliance, reporting, user management) that implement business rules.

---

## 📁 `/models`

- **Purpose**: Defines data structure and database interaction.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - If using an ORM (e.g., Mongoose, Sequelize), defines schemas and relationships.
  - Provides CRUD operations.
- **Analogy**: Blueprints and filing cabinets — defining what data is stored and how it's organized.

---

## 📁 `/middleware`

- **Purpose**: Functions that process requests/responses before/after controllers.
- **Common Uses**:
  - Authentication/authorization (e.g., JWT checks).
  - Logging.
  - Error handling.
  - Request/response formatting.
- **Analogy**: Security checkpoints, logging stations, or quality control steps.

---

## 📁 `/config`

- **Purpose**: Stores configuration files for different parts of the app.
- **Examples**:
  - Database connection settings (`db.js`).
  - Environment-specific variables.
  - External API keys.
  - Swagger/OpenAPI setup.
- **Analogy**: The instruction manual or settings panel for the app.

---

## 📁 `/utils`

- **Purpose**: Reusable utility/helper functions used across the app.
- **Examples**:
  - Date formatting.
  - String manipulation.
  - Validation helpers.
  - JWT utilities.
  - Decision tree factories/utilities.
- **Analogy**: A toolbox with general-purpose tools used across departments.

---

## 📁 `/data`

- **Purpose**: Static or seed data used by the app.
- **Examples**:
  - JSON files (e.g., `climate-zones.json`, `building-classifications.json`).
  - Programmatic configuration files (e.g., `decision-tree-config.js`).
- **Analogy**: Reference books or templates used during setup or runtime.

---

## 📁 `/scripts`

- **Purpose**: Standalone scripts not part of the main request flow.
- **Examples**:
  - Data seeding (`seedData.js`).
  - Deployment automation.
  - Health checks (`health-check.js`).
  - Migration scripts.
- **Analogy**: Maintenance tools or setup wizards used by developers/admins.

---

## 📁 `/tests`

- **Purpose**: Holds all test-related files.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `autojesttest/`: Automated unit/integration tests (e.g., `decisionTreeUtils.test.js`).
  - `manualtest/`: Scripts or instructions for manual testing (e.g., `test-db-connection.js`).
- **Analogy**: Quality assurance department — ensures everything works as expected.

---

## 📄 `package.json`

- **Purpose**: Manifest file for the Node.js project.
- **Contents**:
  - Project metadata (name, version).
  - Script commands (start, test, lint).
  - Dependency list (libraries used).
- **Analogy**: The parts list and instruction manual for building and running the project.
