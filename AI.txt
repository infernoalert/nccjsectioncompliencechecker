# Project Status and Context

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack application with Express.js backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database. The application is a NCC Section J Compliance Checker that allows users to check building compliance with the National Construction Code (NCC) Section J requirements. It includes JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and user roles. The application also includes functionality for managing building classes, climate zones, compliance pathways, and projects for NCC Section J compliance checking.

## Backend Implementation
The backend is built with Express.js and includes:

1. **Models**:
   - User model with fields: username, email, password, role, and createdAt
   - BuildingClass model for NCC building classifications
   - ClimateZone model for climate zone requirements
   - CompliancePathway model for compliance pathways
   - SectionJPart model for Section J parts
   - SpecialRequirement model for special requirements
   - ExemptionAndConcession model for exemptions and concessions
   - Project model for user projects with fields: name, description, buildingType, location, owner, and complianceResults
   - Password hashing with bcrypt

2. **Controllers**:
   - userController.js with CRUD operations (getUsers, getUser, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser)
   - authController.js with authentication operations (register, login, getMe)
   - buildingClassController.js with operations for building classes
   - climateZoneController.js with operations for climate zones
   - compliancePathwayController.js with operations for compliance pathways
   - projectController.js with operations for projects (createProject, getProjects, getProject, updateProject, deleteProject, checkCompliance)

3. **Routes**:
   - userRoutes.js with RESTful endpoints for user operations (admin only)
   - authRoutes.js with authentication endpoints (register, login, getMe)
   - buildingClassRoutes.js with endpoints for building classes
   - climateZoneRoutes.js with endpoints for climate zones
   - compliancePathwayRoutes.js with endpoints for compliance pathways
   - projectRoutes.js with endpoints for projects

4. **Middleware**:
   - errorHandler.js for centralized error handling
   - auth.js for JWT verification and role-based access control

5. **Utils**:
   - jwt.js for token generation and verification

6. **Server Configuration**:
   - MongoDB connection setup
   - Express middleware (cors, json parsing)
   - Route mounting
   - Error handling middleware

7. **Data Seeding**:
   - seeder.js script to populate the database with building classifications, climate zones, and compliance pathways from Decision-Tree.json

## Frontend Implementation
The frontend is built with React and includes:

1. **State Management**:
   - Redux Toolkit for global state
   - userSlice.js with async thunks for API calls
   - authSlice.js with authentication state and operations
   - projectSlice.js with async thunks for project operations

2. **Components**:
   - SignIn.js: Form for user login with email and password
   - SignUp.js: Form for user registration with email validation and password confirmation
   - UserList.js: Displays users in a table (admin only)
   - CreateUser.js: Form for creating new users (admin only)
   - PrivateRoute.js: Component for protected routes with role-based access
   - NewProject.js: Form for creating new projects with building type and location selection
   - UserProject.js: Displays user's projects with Redux integration
   - ProjectDetails.js: Displays detailed information about a specific project

3. **Routing**:
   - React Router for navigation
   - Public routes: signin, signup
   - Protected routes: dashboard, user list, create user (admin only), projects, new project

4. **UI**:
   - Material-UI for styling
   - Responsive design
   - Role-based navigation
   - Form validation for email and password
   - Building type selection with user-friendly descriptions

## Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with two roles: admin and user
- Token storage in Redux state and localStorage
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email validation on the frontend
- Password confirmation and minimum length validation
- Authentication token included in all API requests via axios interceptors

## API Integration
- Frontend communicates with backend via axios
- API base URL: http://localhost:5000/api
- API endpoints:
  - GET /api/users: Fetch all users (admin only)
  - GET /api/users/:id: Fetch a single user (admin only)
  - POST /api/users: Create a new user (admin only)
  - PUT /api/users/:id: Update a user (admin only)
  - DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user (admin only)
  - POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user
  - POST /api/auth/login: Login user
  - GET /api/auth/me: Get current user
  - GET /api/building-classes: Fetch all building classes
  - GET /api/building-classes/:id: Fetch a single building class

## Technical Details
- Backend runs on port 5000
- Frontend runs on port 3000
- MongoDB runs on default port 27017
- Environment variables are used for configuration
- JWT tokens expire after 30 days
- API responses follow a consistent format with success flag and data/error fields

## How to Change User Role to Admin
To change a user's role to admin, you need to use the API directly. You can use a tool like Postman or curl to make a PUT request to the `/api/users/:id` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "role": "admin"
}
```

You need to include the JWT token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token. The token can be obtained by logging in as an admin user.

## How to Run the Application
1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend application:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

This project serves as a foundation for a NCC Section J Compliance Checker application with role-based access control and can be extended with additional features as needed. The application now includes functionality for managing building classes, climate zones, compliance pathways, and projects for NCC Section J compliance checking.
