### ReportService Implementation
The `ReportService` class is responsible for generating comprehensive compliance reports for projects. It works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The service is initialized with a project object and an optional section parameter (defaults to 'full').

2. **Report Generation**: The `generateReport` method orchestrates the report generation process:
   - It starts with basic project information
   - Based on the requested section, it adds specific information:
     - Building classification and climate zone
     - Compliance pathway
     - Building fabric specifications
     - Special requirements
     - Exemptions
     - Section-specific information
     - J1P2 calculations (for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings)

3. **Section-Specific Methods**:
   - `generateProjectInfo`: Returns basic project details
   - `generateBuildingClassificationInfo`: Retrieves and formats building classification data
   - `generateClimateZoneInfo`: Gets climate zone information based on location and includes heating, cooling, and dehumidification data for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings
   - `generateCompliancePathwayInfo`: Determines the appropriate compliance pathway
   - `generateBuildingFabricInfo`: Formats building fabric specifications
   - `generateSpecialRequirementsInfo`: Retrieves special requirements for the building
   - `generateExemptionsInfo`: Checks for applicable exemptions
   - `generateSectionSpecificInfo`: Gets detailed information for a specific NCC section
   - `generateJ1P2CalcInfo`: Calculates J1P2 values (heating, cooling, and thermal energy load) for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings

4. **Data Sources**: The service uses utility functions from `decisionTreeUtils.js` to access data from:
   - `Decision-Tree.json`: Contains the decision tree structure
   - `buildingTypeToClassification.json`: Maps building types to NCC classifications
   - `locationToClimateZone.json`: Maps locations to climate zones and contains heating, cooling, and dehumidification data
   - J1P2 calculation files: Implement the formulas for heating, cooling, and thermal energy load calculations

5. **Error Handling**: Each method includes proper error handling to ensure the report generation process is robust.

The report is then displayed in the frontend using the `ProjectReport.js` component, which renders the data in a structured format with appropriate sections and styling. 

## Creating New Decision Trees

The application uses a modular decision tree structure to store and retrieve compliance-related data. This section explains how to create a new decision tree and integrate it into the system.

### Step 1: Create the Decision Tree JSON File

1. Create a new JSON file in the `backend/data/decision-trees` directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `verification-methods.json`).
2. Structure the file according to the following template:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "section_name": {
    "key1": {
      "property1": "value1",
      "property2": "value2"
    },
    "key2": {
      "property1": "value1",
      "property2": "value2"
    },
    "default": {
      "property1": "default_value1",
      "property2": "default_value2"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `section_name` with the name of your decision tree (e.g., `verification_methods`).
4. Define the keys and properties according to your data structure.
5. Include a `default` key for cases where a specific key is not found.

### Step 2: Update the Decision Tree Configuration

1. Open `backend/data/decision-trees/decision-tree-config.js`.
2. Add your new decision tree name to the `sections` array:

```javascript
sections: [
  'exemptions',
  'building-classifications',
  'climate-zones',
  'compliance-pathways',
  'special-requirements',
  'building-fabric',
  'energy-use',
  'your-new-decision-tree'  // Add your new decision tree here
]
```

### Step 3: Create a Utility Function

1. Open `backend/utils/decisionTreeUtils.js`.
2. Create a new function to retrieve data from your decision tree:

```javascript
const getYourNewDecisionTree = async (key) => {
  try {
    // Get data from the modular structure
    const data = await getSection('your-new-decision-tree');
    if (!data || !data.section_name) {
      throw new Error('No data found');
    }

    // Get the data for the specific key
    const result = data.section_name[key];
    
    // If no specific data found for this key, use the default
    if (!result) {
      return data.section_name.default;
    }

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error getting data for ${key}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

3. Export the new function by adding it to the `module.exports` object:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... existing exports
  getYourNewDecisionTree,
};
```

### Step 4: Update the ReportService

1. Open `backend/services/reportService.js`.
2. Import your new utility function:

```javascript
const {
  // ... existing imports
  getYourNewDecisionTree
} = require('../utils/decisionTreeUtils');
```

3. Add a new property to the constructor:

```javascript
constructor(project, section = 'full') {
  // ... existing properties
  this.yourNewData = null;
}
```

4. Create a new method to generate information from your decision tree:

```javascript
async generateYourNewDataInfo() {
  try {
    // Get the key based on project data
    const key = this.project.someProperty;
    
    // Get the data from the decision tree
    this.yourNewData = await getYourNewDecisionTree(key);
    
    return {
      // Return the data in a structured format
      property1: this.yourNewData.property1,
      property2: this.yourNewData.property2
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      error: `Error getting data: ${error.message}`
    };
  }
}
```

5. Update the `generateReport` method to include your new data:

```javascript
async generateReport() {
  try {
    // ... existing code

    if (this.section === 'full' || this.section === 'your-section') {
      report.yourNewData = await this.generateYourNewDataInfo();
    }

    // ... existing code
  } catch (error) {
    // ... error handling
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Update the Frontend Component

1. Open the relevant frontend component (e.g., `frontend/src/components/ProjectReport.js`).
2. Add a new section to display your data:

```jsx
{/* Your New Data Section */}
{report.yourNewData && (
  <Box sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
    <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
      Your New Data Section
    </Typography>
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1">Property 1</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          {report.yourNewData.property1}
        </Typography>
      </Grid>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <Typography variant="subtitle1">Property 2</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
          {report.yourNewData.property2}
        </Typography>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  </Box>
)}
```

### Example: Adding Verification Methods

As an example, to add verification methods to the energy use section:

1. Create `verification-methods.json` with verification methods for each building classification.
2. Add 'verification-methods' to the sections array in `decision-tree-config.js`.
3. Create `getVerificationMethods` function in `decisionTreeUtils.js`.
4. Update `generateEnergyUseInfo` in `reportService.js` to include verification methods.
5. Update the energy use section in `ProjectReport.js` to display verification methods.

This modular approach allows for easy addition of new decision trees and integration with the existing report generation system. 

### Example: Adding Climate Data for Specific Building Classes

As an example of how we added heating, cooling, and dehumidification data for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings:

1. Updated the `locationToClimateZone.json` file to include heating, cooling, and dehumidification data for each location.
2. Updated the `generateClimateZoneInfo` method in `reportService.js` to include this data for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings.
3. Updated the `ProjectReport.js` component to conditionally display this data based on the building class.

This approach allows for easy addition of new data to the report based on specific building classifications. 

### Example: Adding J1P2 Calculations

As an example of how we added J1P2 calculations for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings:

1. Created three JavaScript files in the `backend/data/decision-trees` directory:
   - `j1p2totalheatingload.js`: Implements the heating load calculation formula
   - `j1p2totalcoolingload.js`: Implements the cooling load calculation formula
   - `j1p2thermalenergyload.js`: Implements the thermal energy load calculation formula
2. Updated the `generateJ1P2CalcInfo` method in `reportService.js` to use these files
3. The calculations are only displayed for Class_2 and Class_4 buildings
4. The data is sourced from the `locationToClimateZone.json` file

This approach allows for easy addition of new calculations to the report based on specific building classifications.
